# Data Cleaning

#### Introduction

Since CBS provided us already cleaned data, it was not possible to do a lot of data cleaning for this project. 

<details><summary>Fixing timestamps</summary>

One of the issues with the data provided by CBS was the timestamps were not converted to readable and useful times yet. 

Example of the unconverted timestamp. The 2 long integers should be together and converted to a readable timestamp.

The following function has been used to convert the unreadable timestamps.
