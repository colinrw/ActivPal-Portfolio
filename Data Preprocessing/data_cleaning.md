# Data Cleaning

#### Introduction

Since CBS provided us already cleaned data, it was not possible to do a lot of data cleaning for this project. 

<details><summary>Fixing timestamps</summary>

One of the issues with the data provided by CBS was the timestamps were not converted to readable and useful times yet. 

Example of the unconverted timestamp. The 2 long integers should be together and converted to a readable timestamp.

The following function has been used to convert the unreadable timestamps.

<details><summary>Switching Diceface</summary>

A Diceface is the direction the activPAL is facing. The issue we are facing is when a respondent flips from its front to the back, the measured X, Y and Z values also flip sides. To solve this, we changed to X, Y and Z values according the switch in diceface value. 

Example of the diceface directions [found here](http://docs.palt.com/display/AL/MORA):

The following images were provided by Brian Keijzer and has been used to determine how to flip the dicefaces.

Here is an example how this transformation has been done in code. We used diceface `1` as a baseline to convert to. These convertion functions are written by Adnan and me.

*During the MET model creation the feature `sum of magnitude of acceleration (sum_mag_acc)` was used, this feature adds the X, Y and Z values together. Therefore, the diceface convertion was not needed in the end.*

The entire notebook can be found [here](../Images/Data%20Preprocessing/Code/normalize_diceface_values-v3.py).
