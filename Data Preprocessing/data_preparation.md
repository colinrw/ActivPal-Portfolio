|Description|Function|
|------|------|
|Convert `ja/nee` string to number| ![](../Images/Data%20Preprocessing/convert_string_to_number.PNG) |
|Convert `age` to categorical number| ![](../Images/Data%20Preprocessing/convert_age_category.PNG) |
The remaining functions can be found at the top of [this](../Images/Data%20Preprocessing/Code/creating_main_dataframe.py) notebook.
