# Task Definition

This project is a collaboration between The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) and Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS). 

<details><summary>Introduction</summary>

Statistic Netherlands wants to know if it's possible to measure if respondents meet the proposed 150 minutes of moderate intense physical activities within a week. The current method of collecting information from respondents is asking questions with different surveys. This comes with issues, one of them is that respondents don't always know the exact answers and this results in inaccurate results. Therefore, CBS decided to invite 40 random respondents to participate in this experiment. Every respondent received an activPAL device and had it mounted on their upper thigh. This activPAL device measured different types of data which has to be used to answer the following research questions.

<details><summary>Research Questions</summary>

*These research questions were created by my colleagues, so I am not taking any credits for them.*

This research contains *3* different research questions. All with different sub-questions. The first 2 questions are necessary to answer before answering the final question.

### Question 1

How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed in a lab situation by a person, who is being monitored with Vyntus One device and wearing an activPAL accelerometer? 

##### Sub Questions
- What measurement does activPAL use for intensity and why?  
- Is it possible to extract this intensity measurement values from just Vyntus One data, if so, how?  

### Question 2

How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed by a person wearing only the activPAL accelerometer, based on the data gathered from the Vyntus One device and the ActivPal accelerometer in the lab situation? 

##### Sub Question
- What machine learning model can best be used to measure the intensity for each activity?  

### Question 3

How can Machine Learning be used to determine whether people did their 150 minutes of moderate activity in the activPAL accelerometer data of an entire week? 

##### Sub Question
- How can Machine Learning be used to recognize the activities, performed in the lab situation, in the activPAL accelerometer data?
