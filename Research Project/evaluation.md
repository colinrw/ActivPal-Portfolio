<details><summary>Introduction</summary>

During this project it was not possible to execute all experiments. Different causes were, not enough knowledge, time or data. This chapter contains different subjects for future research.

<details><summary>Too Little Data</summary>

To make predictions for the MET regression models it is necessary to have enough data so the model could generalize. This was not the case. From the 40 respondents, only 25 were useful for our experiments. The results of this was that our MET predictions models were *overfitting*, which resulted in inaccurate results for the calculation of the 150 minutes moderate intense physical activity.  

##### Recommendation

For future research on this topic I recommend more data. One of the main reasons why we were not able to answer the main research question with more certainty was because of too little data for our experiments.
