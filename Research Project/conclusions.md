# Conclusions

In this conclusion chapter I will go over the research questions and conclude my perspective on the final results. 

<details><summary>Research Question 1</summary>

##### How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed in a lab situation by a person, who is being monitored with Vyntus One device and wearing an activPAL accelerometer? 

My conclusion after analyzing the MET regression models ([results can be found here](../Predictive%20Analysis/evaluating_a_model.md)) is that all Random Forest and XGBoost models seem to overfit. The models gave decent results before applying the test data set, but once the test data set was applied to results worsened. Generalizing during the training of the model was not done accurately due to not having enough respondents in the data set. 

To get back to answering the research question. It *is* possible to predict the intensity, but the predictions are not very reliable since the models are not giving accurate predictions.
