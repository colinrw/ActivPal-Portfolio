# Writing Paper

I started a bit later than the rest because I was still finishing the MET Regression Models. 

|Chapter|Contribution|Link/Example|
|------------|--------|--------|
|MET Regression Models V1 |This was part of the `methods` chapter. Here I wrote how the MET regression models were realised. Starting with data preparation, features engineering and finally training and evaluating the models.  | ![here](../Images/Communication/met_regression_models_V1.docx)
|MET Regression Models V2 ||
|MET Regression Results V1 ||
|MET Regression Results V2 ||
|Conclusion V1 |The first conclusion was made with Adnan. We started with writing down the results and own conclusions of the models we both created. Afterwards we reviewed each others conclusions and came up with an overall conclusion. Resulting in an conclusion from 2 perspectives. | ![](../Images/Communication/conclusion-V1-adnan.PNG)
|Conclusion V2 |After receive feedback on `Conclusion V1` I started with writing V2. Answering the main research question was not done concisely and certain conclusions were not strongly substantiated. While writing V2 I made sure these points were processed. |![](../Images/Communication/conclusion-V2.PNG)
|Reviewing Team Members|There is no proof of actual reviewing besides the comments in the document. During the reviewing I tried to be very critical, even though we did not want to publish our research in an actual paper.|  ![](../Images/Communication/review-example.PNG)

Chapters I wrote:
- MET method iteration 1 and 2 
- MET results > iteration 1
- Conclusion together with Adnan Akbas > iteration 1, 2 and 3

I did a lot of reviewing. I tried being very critical to make sure the paper would look very professional. 

I researched how to make professional looking tables for the research paper.
