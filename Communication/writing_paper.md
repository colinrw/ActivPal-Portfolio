# Writing Paper

I started a bit later than the rest because I was still finishing the MET Regression Models. 

Chapters I wrote:
- MET method iteration 1 and 2 
- MET results > iteration 1
- Conclusion together with Adnan Akbas > iteration 1, 2 and 3

I did a lot of reviewing. I tried being very critical to make sure the paper would look very professional. 

I researched how to make professional looking tables for the research paper.
