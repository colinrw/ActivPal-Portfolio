<details><summary>Reflection on own learning objectives</summary>

##### Situation

This Applied Data Science minor was a very new subject, so my overall knowledge of the subject was minimum. I had some experience with Python programming, but very little. This would mean a lot of new excited things to be learnt!

##### Task

My main focus was aimed on the technical part of the project. This would mean, data preparation, data pre-processing and configuring models. There were times I had to do literature research, but minimum. 

##### Actions

Once we received the data I wanted to immediately start with exploring the data, but literature study had to be done first. After this part was over I did a lot of data exploration and pre-processing for the models. 

After a few weeks of working with the data I thought that I was missing out on the creation of a model. I decided to switch my focus on researching different models and how to pre-process, configure, train and evaluate a model. 

##### Result

Following the Datacamp courses and applying this knowledge in practice improved my Python programming skills a lot! I learned about different Library's which I will use for further projects. 

I've learned a lot about Machine Learning models. I was always fascinated about this technique and never knew how a computer could learn. After this minor I have a very good understanding about the creation of a Machine Learning model. Mainly about Regression models, since this is what I've been working on most of the time during this project.

##### Reflection

The first few weeks of this project was mainly focused on literature research. This was in my opinion the least pleasant part, but if I look back, one of the most important parts to make good progress. I should've focused a bit more on this in the beginning of the project. This would speed up the understanding of the problem domain and Machine Learning models. 

During this minor I learned a lot. The most exciting part is being able to create, configure and understand different Machine Learning models. Besides this, I learned to work with raw data and turn this to useful information. I am able to evaluate and visualize my results. 

If I look back at what I learnt throughout this minor I am happy with my choices. The only thing I wanted to learn more about is different Machine Learning models that were not used in our project and the implication of Neural Networks.

# Research project

<details><summary>Task definition</summary>

This project is a collaboration between The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) and Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS). 

<details><summary>Introduction</summary>

Statistic Netherlands wants to know if it's possible to measure if respondents meet the proposed 150 minutes of moderate intense physical activities within a week. The current method of collecting information from respondents is asking questions with different surveys. This comes with issues, one of them is that respondents don't always know the exact answers and this results in inaccurate results. Therefore, CBS decided to invite 40 random respondents to participate in this experiment. Every respondent received an activPAL device and had it mounted on their upper thigh. This activPAL device measured different types of data which has to be used to answer the following research questions.

<details><summary>Research Questions</summary>

*These research questions were created by my colleagues, so I am not taking any credits for them.*

This research contains *3* different research questions. All with different sub-questions. The first 2 questions are necessary to answer before answering the final question.

### Question 1

How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed in a lab situation by a person, who is being monitored with Vyntus One device and wearing an activPAL accelerometer? 

##### Sub Questions
- What measurement does activPAL use for intensity and why?  
- Is it possible to extract this intensity measurement values from just Vyntus One data, if so, how?  

### Question 2

How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed by a person wearing only the activPAL accelerometer, based on the data gathered from the Vyntus One device and the ActivPal accelerometer in the lab situation? 

##### Sub Question
- What machine learning model can best be used to measure the intensity for each activity?  

### Question 3

How can Machine Learning be used to determine whether people did their 150 minutes of moderate activity in the activPAL accelerometer data of an entire week? 

##### Sub Question
- How can Machine Learning be used to recognize the activities, performed in the lab situation, in the activPAL accelerometer data?
