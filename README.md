##### Situation

This Applied Data Science minor was a very new subject, so my overall knowledge of the subject was minimum. I had some experience with Python programming, but very little. This would mean a lot of new excited things to be learnt!

##### Task

My main focus was aimed on the technical part of the project. This would mean, data preparation, data pre-processing and configuring models. There were times I had to do literature research, but minimum. 

##### Actions

Once we received the data I wanted to immediately start with exploring the data, but literature study had to be done first. After this part was over I did a lot of data exploration and pre-processing for the models. 

After a few weeks of working with the data I thought that I was missing out on the creation of a model. I decided to switch my focus on researching different models and how to pre-process, configure, train and evaluate a model. 

##### Result

Following the Datacamp courses and applying this knowledge in practice improved my Python programming skills a lot! I learned about different Library's which I will use for further projects. 

I've learned a lot about Machine Learning models. I was always fascinated about this technique and never knew how a computer could learn. After this minor I have a very good understanding about the creation of a Machine Learning model. Mainly about Regression models, since this is what I've been working on most of the time during this project.

##### Reflection

The first few weeks of this project was mainly focused on literature research. This was in my opinion the least pleasant part, but if I look back, one of the most important parts to make good progress. I should've focused a bit more on this in the beginning of the project. This would speed up the understanding of the problem domain and Machine Learning models. 

During this minor I learned a lot. The most exciting part is being able to create, configure and understand different Machine Learning models. Besides this, I learned to work with raw data and turn this to useful information. I am able to evaluate and visualize my results. 

If I look back at what I learnt throughout this minor I am happy with my choices. The only thing I wanted to learn more about is different Machine Learning models that were not used in our project and the implication of Neural Networks.
