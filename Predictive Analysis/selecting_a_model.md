# Selecting a model

### Introduction
To answer one of the research questions within our project we had to create a model to predict the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) value of given activities. These tasks differentiate between `Running`, `Walking` and a combination of `Cycling Light` and `Cycling Heavy`.

Solving this issue would require a regression model since we need to predict an `integer/double` value(MET) and don't need classification in this case. 

### Approach
My approach for solving this problem was looking at different regression models. I started with finding different models and noting their pros and cons and eventually comparing them to pick atleast 2 possible models. I decided to pick 2 possible models and implement them with the same configurations instead of 1 to prevent getting biased results. 

### Different Regression Models
I researched different regression models to find a possible candidate model for our issue.

##### Random Forest ([source](https://medium.com/swlh/random-forest-and-its-implementation-71824ced454f))
The Random Forest model is a decision tree model which can both be used for Regression and Classification. Besides being a possible regression model, the Random Forest model makes use of `Ensembled Learning`. Ensembled learning means combining multiple results to 1 final result, this method would give more accurate results and minimize getting biased results.
